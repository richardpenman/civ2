# Developing OpenCiv2

How the reconstruction is organized and checked. Building and playing: [README.md](../README.md);
progress: [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `src/auto/` | The game: decompiled once, now C++ edited directly, a file per subject (`city.cpp`, `unit.cpp`, `ai.cpp`, `diplomacy.cpp`, `map.cpp`, `window.cpp` …). |
| `src/game/` | Functions the decompiler could not translate, reconstructed by hand. |
| `src/data/` | The game's static data (`gamedata.h`/`.cpp`), laid out exactly as in the original. |
| `src/include/` | Types recovered from the binary: units, cities, civilizations, map, the game's classes. |
| `src/platform/` | The Windows API the game uses (windows, GDI, controls, files, sound, video) implemented in portable C. |
| `src/host/` | What the platform layer needs from the machine: window, input and audio over SDL2; the portable build's runtime. |
| `src/native/` | The C runtime pieces the native builds need. |
| `src/third_party/` | Bundled third-party decoders (Indeo 4 video, Ogg Vorbis). |
| `data/` | Fonts as the original renders them, and the original executable's data sections. |
| `re/` | Analysis results: function list, calling conventions, data layout, Ghidra's decompilation. |
| `harness/` | The replay scripts and the comparison with the original (`run.py`, `compare.py`, `native_suite.sh`). |
| `tests/` | Small standalone tests (data layout, network records, CD music reading). |
| `hook/` | An `XDaemon.dll` proxy that makes the original deterministic under Wine. |
| `tools/` | Build, analysis and refactoring scripts. |
| `docs/` | Notes on the reconstruction and its verification; progress in `STATUS.md`. |

## Approach

1. **Inventory**: Ghidra decompiles all ~4,900 functions; names and types for every function,
   global, class and field were recovered from their use.
2. **Translation**: the decompiled code was turned into C that compiles natively, then edited
   by hand: names, types, struct access, real locals, data as ordinary variables. It is now C++
   (`docs/hand-reconstruction.md`).
3. **Platform**: the game keeps calling the Windows API; `src/platform` implements the part it
   uses on top of SDL2, so the same game code runs everywhere.
4. **Determinism**: under Wine, the `hook/` proxy DLL pins the original's random seed, gives it a
   virtual clock and replays recorded input. The native builds do the same, so a recorded
   scenario plays identically in both.
5. **Differential harness**: each scenario in `harness/scripts` (new game, turns, cities,
   diplomacy, editors, 50 turns of play …) is recorded from the original once; the native builds
   replay it and must produce the same screenshots and the same sequence of `rand()` calls.
   Changes to the code are also checked function by function against the previous version's
   machine code (`tools/cxx_compare.py`), which covers the code no scenario reaches.

## Tooling

Development runs in Docker on Linux; `tools/dk CMD` runs a command in the dev container with
the repository at `/work` and the game at `/civ2`.

| Tool | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Docker images (`make images`) | Wine (runs the original), MinGW, g++/gcc with 32-bit support, SDL2, Python; Ghidra for the analysis. |
| wasi-sdk + wabt (`tools/fetch-toolchain.sh`) | The portable build: the game compiles to a wasm32 module (keeping the original's 32-bit data model), which wasm2c turns into C for any machine. |
| `hook/` (`make hook`) | The proxy DLL that makes the original replayable. |

```sh
make native          # build/civ2-linux32: gcc -m32, the same code, easier to debug
make port            # build/OpenCiv2 in the container
make ref SCRIPT=harness/scripts/turns.txt    # record the original on a scenario
make native-suite    # replay every scenario on a native build and compare (EXE=OpenCiv2, OpenCiv2.exe under Wine)
```

## Stack preset evidence

The [stack compatibility policy](stack-compatibility.md) keeps the current
presets while distinguishing entry samples from original consumer behavior.
`python3 tools/stackprobe_report.py LOG [LOG ...]` summarizes `CIV2_STACKPROBE`
logs without modifying them. Its standalone format and CLI tests need only
Python's standard library:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_stackprobe_report.py' -v
```
